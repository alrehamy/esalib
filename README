My implementation of Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) library that we used at KMi, Open University to produce our submission at the NTCIR-9 CrossLink task. 

== Changelog ==

29.9.2012 - added support for SQLite, so that the library is better usable for fast prototyping

25.3.2012 - initial release

== Files ==
 - /example - see example data in /example where you can find an ESA background built from Wikipedia snapshot from 2005, and directly use it in our tools for assessing semantic similarity of English textis/words.

 - /tutorial - basic instructions for building your own background

 - /lib - Java libraries required to run


== So how to get ESA running in 2 minutes for English? ==
0.
        # git co https://github.com/ticcky/esalib.git
        # cd esalib

1. Create a symbolic link to the sample database
        # ln -s examples/esadb.db

2. Get relatedness estimate of two texts:
        # ./run_analyzer "computer" "apple"


Please don't hessitate to get in touch if you want to use my library but have troubles with it.
