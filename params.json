Download the repo with the pre-built jar and database\r\n```\r\n$ git co https://github.com/ticcky/esalib.git\r\n$ cd esalib\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Create a symbolic link to the sample database\r\n```\r\n$ ln -s examples/esa_en.db esadb.db\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Get relatedness estimate of two texts:\r\n```\r\n$ ./run_analyzer \"computer\" \"apple\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What to do if you are struggling with something?\r\nJust email me for help ;)\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nSource code is partially based on the [original implementation of Evgeniy Gabrilovich](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~gabr/resources/code/esa/esa.html).\r\n\r\nI was working under supervision of [Petr Knoth](http://people.kmi.open.ac.uk/petr/).","google":"UA-15431286-4"}
